<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project exists for IFE PV system researchers to pour their souls into practicing making their code _available_, in all senses of the word. Code can be available on at least three levels. These levels are:
* It is possible for other people to download and use the code
* It is easy to understand what the code is doing
* It is easy to enhance the code by changing and adding to it
The first level is the bare minimum of making code available. The more levels we manage to implement, the more useful the code will be.
